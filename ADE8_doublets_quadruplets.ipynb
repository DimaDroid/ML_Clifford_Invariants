    "The Jupyter Notebook introduces Python classes designed to analyze frequencies of classes of invariants sharing similar components. It implements `Permutation` and `PermutationRep` classes enabling operations such as generating inverses, determining Black-White or Black-White-Centre color representations, and comparing these classes based on symmetries within their components. The analysis within the A8 algebra demonstrates that classes with matching frequencies exhibit relationships via Black-White inversion and inversion, explaining the occurrence of doublets and quadruplets. In E8, some doublet frequencies are explained by inversion, while the rest remain unclear. D8 displays explanations for some doublets and quadruplets through inversion and 6<->7 symmetries, hinting at further identifiable symmetries."
