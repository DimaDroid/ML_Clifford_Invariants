Data analysis and supervised learning techniques applied to Clifford invariants of Coxeter elements.

The ADE8_classification.ipynb notebook illustrates the application of supervised learning to classification Geometric invariants of A8, D8 and E8 algebras.

The ADE8_frequencies.ipynb contains the analysis of the A8, D8 and E8 algebras' invariants components. We found the number of unique invariants (classes) and the number of occurrences of invariants from each of the classes (frequencies).

The ADE8_subinvariant_frequencies.ipynb contains the analysis of the A8, D8 and E8 algebras' subinvariants components: scalar, bivector, quadrivaector, sextuvector and pseudoscalar parts. We found the number of unique subinvariants (classes) and the number of occurrences of subinvariants from each of the classes (frequencies).
